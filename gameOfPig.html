  <p>In this iteration of the game, you can choose between two and 10 players. The player to go first is decided randomly. In order to deter rerolling infinitely, if both dice are less than or equal to the number of consecutive rolls, the player's score is reset to zero and his turn is over; if only one of the dice is less than or equal to the number of consecutive rolls, the player's turn is over but his score is not reset to zero. On the other hand, the sum of the dice is increased by a factor of 0.5 for every consecutive roll. If both dice are greater than the number of consecutive rolls, the increased sum of both dice is added to the player's score.<br><br><br>You set a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 100 at which you want the game to end at the beginning of the game.
